The 2020 year will surely go down as a memorable one in the books. I got my first house, got my first wife, experienced my first global pandemic, and witnessed my first major attempted insurrection of the US government. Same old, same old. 
<br><br>
The jury is still out on the lasting impacts of COVID-19 on the world at large, but I can already see some changes that will likely stay with my life. I know that working remotely is actually much more enjoyable than I imagined, wearing a mask is something I'll continue doing during commutes/travel even for allergy reasons, and that my previous idea of work life balance was certainly lacking. Call me a glass half full kind of guy. 
<br><br>
The winter break gave me a renewed energy going into 2021. This post is primarily intended to serve as a reminder of where my mind was at to start the year. I started following a new bullet journaling system for personal goal tracking, but I wanted to get my technical goals down in writing (typing?) too:
- [ ] Build a project in typescript
- [ ] Publish a react native proejct on the apple and google play stores
- [ ] Make <a href="https://devstuff.shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devstuff.shop</a> profitable
- [ ] Get a professional certification

<br>
The latest <a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Front End Happy Hour podcast</a> episode about <a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/building-side-projects-served-with-a-tasty-sidecar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building side projects</a> really rekindled some of the fire that I was lacking in 2020. I was kind of burnt out after getting my first real "developer" job so I want to find the magic again that got me so interested in code in the first place.
