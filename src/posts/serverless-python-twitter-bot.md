After getting my AWS Certified Cloud Practioner certification earlier this year, I thought it made sense to add a small AWS project to my portfolio. I really enjoy doing a small, silly project every once in awhile to keep things fun and get some momentum going. Getting a few small wins under my belt every once in awhile helps me focus on larger and more complex projects.

That thought process led me to create a small twitter bot that would tweet every 5 hours with an inspiring quote. It let me use some python, the tweepy library to access the twitter API, and AWS lambda functions.
