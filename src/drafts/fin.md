Tutorial hell. Any self-taught or junior developer has probably been there before. You've learned some basic programming syntax, watched a lot of tutorials, and maybe read some documentation. Putting it all together and _actually_ building something though? That's a different story.

They say the best way to learn and stay motivated is to build something you'll actually use. That is why I am starting to build my first Django app. I've really enjoyed learning python for scripting at my day job so this seems like a natural next step to put it all together with the general web development and javascript skills I already had.

This Django project will be called "Fin" and it is largely inspired by "Done", a popular iPhone app that lets you set goals that you aim to accomplish in specific time periods. For example, I have daily goals on the app for exercising and weekly goals for algorithm practice. The idea of the app is awesome, but there are definitely some things I have in mind that could improve it. Now let's see if I can actually bring them to life.
