My path into tech was a bit atypical. I had an idea for a subscription ecommerce business while working at a tech startup called [Cratejoy](https://www.cratejoy.com/), but the problem was that I hated relying on other people building out my vision. That led me to enroll in a web development bootcamp to pick up some techincal skills so I could get my hands dirty. I used those skills to build and launch Smash Crate. That business focused on distributing Super Smash Bros video game fanart content as a subscription service and was much more successful than I ever anticipated. 
<br><br>
That roller coaster ride took up over 2 years of my life, but I learned so much from the experience. I am now preparing to launch my new business, [devstuff.shop](https://devstuff.shop/)
<br><br>
I love being a developer, but I hate looking for just the right stickers, shirts, or other items that showcase the various inside jokes that come with the trade. I hope to make devstuff.shop the place to find all of those things.
