description: "Building a progressive web app calculator with react.js"

I haven't done a project in awhile, but the quarantine is really saving me a lot of commute time these days so I have no excuses. I decided to build a react calculator app. This is also one of the freeCodeCamp curriculum projects. I have had a long oustanding personal goal of completing the entire curriculum.

The one thing I wanted to do to make this a bit more unique was to make it a progressive web application ("PWA" for short).
