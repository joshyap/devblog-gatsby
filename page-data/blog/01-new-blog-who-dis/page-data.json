If you haven't heard of Gatsby, I've really enjoyed it. The buzz is certainly warranted. Allow me to elaborate.\n<br><br>\nFirst off, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a> is an open-source frontend framework with a focus on building fast websites and webapps. It is based on React and is very good at playing nice with different CMS's and APIs. At its heart though, Gatsby is a static site generator. Think of a static site as the types of small web pages that you might've built when first learning about web development (the type that just use plain old HTML, CSS, and javascript).\n<br><br>\nGatsby allows you to utilize modern tools while compiling everything down to the basic building blocks of the web. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"01-new-blog-who-dis"}},
