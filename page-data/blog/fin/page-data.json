Any self-taught or junior developer has probably been there before. You've learned some basic programming syntax, watched a lot of tutorials, and maybe read some documentation. Putting it all together and <em>actually</em> building something though? That's a different story.\n<br><br>\nThey say the best way to learn and stay motivated is to build something you'll actually use. That is why I am starting to build my first Django app. I've really enjoyed learning python for scripting at my day job so this seems like a natural next step to put it all together with the general web development and javascript skills I already had.\n<br><br>\nThis Django project will be called \"Fin\" and it is largely inspired by \"Done\", a popular iPhone app that lets you set goals that you aim to accomplish in specific time periods. For example, I have daily goals on the app for exercising and weekly goals for algorithm practice. The idea of the app is awesome, but there are definitely some things I have in mind that could improve it. Now let's see if I can actually bring them to life. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fin"}},
