It's like when you decide to pick up some dystopian young adult novels for light reading to build some momentum and get back into the habit of reading. That is why I decided to build this Voowols project.\n<br><br>\nWe have a slack channel at work called \"voowols\". This channel is sort of like a water cooler in the office. It is intended for free talk about whatever is on your mind, but it does have one rule: <br>\nevery word you type has to have every \"o\" replaced with \"oo\" and every non \"o\" vowel has to be replaced with an \"o\"\n<br><br>\nJust replacing the vowels with O's is boring though. The real fun is reading out the newly formed sentences. I was able to do that using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis\">speech synthesis web API</a>, which actually allows for control of reading rate, language, and pitch. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"06-voowols"}},
