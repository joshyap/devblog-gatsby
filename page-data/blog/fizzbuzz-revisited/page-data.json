They were basically asking for a classic fizzbuzz solution, but simply used a different name.</p>\n<p>It was simple to do if you knew basic programming, but especially so if you already knew the fizzbuzz problem. My brother solved it in a very straightforward way that had no flaws. We discussed his solution afterwards and I recommended that he talk through his solution more and what considerations he took into account. This is how you show the interviewer your thought process.</p>\n<p>For example, my brother solved the problem in a few minutes, but did not think to offer suggestions on alternative things he could do to solve the problem. He showcased a for loop with some modulus operators, but did not acknowledge that he could have used a switch statement, a recursive function, or a ternary operator. I wasn't that surprised that he didn't suggest a ternary solution though since our conversation was the first time he had ever heard of it!</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I was programming for nearly a year before I learned about ternary operators. I still don't use them because, in my opinion, any advantages that gain from brevity are outweighed by the loss in readability for anyone that is unfamiliar.</p>\n<br>\nHere is my proposed fizzbuzz solution using a ternary operator:\n<p><code>i % 15 ? i % 5 i % 3 ? i:\"fizz\":\"buzz\":\"fizzbuzz\")</code></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fizzbuzz-revisited"}},
